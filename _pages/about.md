I am an Assistant Professor and [RDAR](https://rdar.ca/) Chair in Applied Agricultural Economics and Risk Management at the University of Alberta in the Department of Resource Economics and Environmental Sociology ([REES](https://www.ualberta.ca/resource-economics-environmental-sociology/index.html)) in Edmonton, Alberta. 

My research focuses on topics related to agricultural policy, markets, and farm management. I grew up on a grain farm near Eston, Saskatchewan, so I am naturally interested in issues that affect farmers such as grain handling and transportation, grain marketing, investment in agricultural R&D, intellectual property and plant breeders' rights, and agri-environmental policy.
